/**
 * The openMDX Service Data Object interface.
 * <p>
 * The core of the openMDX Data Accessor Framework is the Service Data 
 * Object ({@code SDO}), which is a generic object and is not tied to any 
 * specific persistent storage or service mechanism. An {@code SDO} is used 
 * in conjunction with data accessors which populate {@code SDO}s from back-end 
 * data sources. For more information on {@code SDO}s see the
 * <a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-sdo/">SDO specification</a>. 
 * <p> 
 * An openMDX {@code SDO} implements the {@code DataObject_1_0} 
 * interface. The API gives access to typed and untyped {@code SDO}s. This 
 * has the following advantages:
 * <p>
 * <ul><li>Data Objects often have typed interfaces. However, sometimes it is
 *   either impossible or undesirable to create interfaces to represent the 
 *   Data Objects. One common reason for this is when the data being transferred 
 *   is defined by the output of a query. Examples would be:
 *   <ul>
 *     <li>A relational query against a relational persistence store.
 *     <li>An EJBQL queries against an EJB entity bean domain model.
 *     <li>Web services.
 *     <li>XML queries against an XML source.
 *     <li>When deployment of generated code is not practical.
 *   </ul>
 *   In these situations, it is necessary to use a dynamic store and associated 
 *   API. {@code DataObject_1_0} has the ability to represent Data Objects 
 *   through a standard generic data API.
 * <li>In cases where metadata is known at development time (for example, the 
 *   UML model or the SQL relational schema is known), {@code DataObject_1_0} 
 *   allows a generic interface to access typed objects such as
 *   <ul><li>Popular XML schema languages.
 *     <li>Relational database schemas with queries known at the time of code generation.
 *     <li>Web services, when the message is specified by an XML schema.
 *     <li>JCA connectors.
 *     <li>JMS message formats.
 *     <li>UML models
 *   </ul>
 * <li>Many applications are coded with built-in knowledge of the shape of the data
 *   being returned. These applications know which methods to call or fields to 
 *   access on the Data Objects they use. However, in order to enable development 
 *   of generic or framework code that works with Data Objects, it is important to 
 *   be able to introspect on Data Object metadata, which exposes the data model for 
 *   the Data Objects. The object class of a Data Object allows to retrieve the
 *   object's metadata from a {@code MOF} repository.
 * </ul>N
 * <p>
 * A {@code DataObject_1_0} extends from the {@code javax.jdo.spi.PersistenceCapable}.
 * As a consequence, a {@code DataObject_1_0} offers the semantics as a {@code JDO 
 * PersistenceCapable}. A {@code DataObject_1_0} is managed by
 * a Data Access Service (which is in turn a {@code javax.jdo.PersistenceManager}) 
 * and maintains the object states and lifecycle defined by the 
 * <a href="http://java.sun.com/jdo/index.jsp">JDO specification</a>.    
 * <p>
 * Summarized a {@code DataObject_1_0} 
 * <ul>
 *   <li>is conceptually an {@code SDO} specified by the <a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-sdo/">SDO specification</a>. 
 *     However, it does not implement the {@code commonj.sdo.DataObject} interface 
 *     mainly for the following reasons: 1) The object states and lifecycle are not as complete 
 *     and precisely specified as the {@code javax.jdo.spi.PersistenceCapable} does.
 *     2) The many typed getters and setters are replaced by untyped getters and setters
 *     which make the interface easier to use and to implement. Attribute types can
 *     be derived from a {@code MOF} repository.
 *   <li>implements the the interface {@code javax.jdo.spi.PersistenceCapable} and adds
 *     generic attribute value setters and getters. It also adds methods which allow to
 *     invoke operations on {@code SDO}s.
 * </ul>
