      dateTimePrecision option as
      * SECONDS
      * MILLISECONDS
      * MICROSECONDS (default)

      It is applied under the following conditions:
      * The protocol between PERSISTENCE and MODEL layer uses XML data types
      * the value refers to a time point after 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z
      * the column includes a timezone in case of write operations 
      
      CR20018955
      VirtualObjects_2
      
      The new plug-in is well known to Switch_1 as it provides virtual objects 
      on an object id base, overriding the ports configured for any matching 
      pattern.
      
      There are two ways to inject virtual objects:
      * as deployment configuration one can provide pattern/class pairs for 
        final classes
      * via the VirtualObjects_2_0.putSeed(Path,objectClass) method plug-ins 
        are able to inject objects at run-time
      
      The default configuration is

        <property 
        	name="org.openmdx.jdo.DataManager.virtualObjectPlugIn" 
        	value="org.openmdx.virtual.PlugIn"
        />
		<!-- ... -->
        <property 
        	name="org.openmdx.virtual.PlugIn.class" 
        	value="org.openmdx.base.accessor.rest.spi.VirtualObjects_2"
        />
        <property 
        	name="org.openmdx.virtual.PlugIn.finalPattern[0]" 
        	value="xri://@openmdx*($..)"
        />
        <property
        	name="org.openmdx.virtual.PlugIn.finalPattern[1]" 
        	value="xri://@openmdx*($..)/provider/($..)"
        />
        <prop20018969erty
        	name="org.openmdx.virtual.PlugIn.finalClass[0]"
        	value="org:openmdx:base:Authority"
        />
        <property
        	name="org.openmdx.virtual.PlugIn.finalClass[1]"
			value="org:openmdx:base:Provider"
		/>

      The VirtualObjects_2_0 instance is retrieved through

		VirtualObjects_2_0 virtualObjects = SharedObjects.getPlugInObject(
			persistenceManager, 
			VirtualObjects_2_0.class
		);
				
      CR20018905
      UUIDs
      
      The expression UUIDs.newUUID() is now preferred over 
      UUIDs.getGenerator().next() as the former one reuses thread local UUID
      generators while the latter one creates a new generator on each 
      invocation.
      
      CR20018820 	
      View Manager Plug-Ins 
      
      The view manager interceptors are now pluggable, e.g.
      
        <property 
        	name="org.openmdx.jdo.ViewManager.plugIn[0]" 
        	value="org.openmdx.base.PlugIn"
        />
        <property 
        	name="org.openmdx.jdo.ViewManager.plugIn[1]" 
        	value="org.openmdx.state2.PlugIn"
        />
        <property 
        	name="org.openmdx.state2.PlugIn.class" 
        	value="org.openmdx.state2.aop1.PlugIn_1"
        />
        <property 
        	name="org.openmdx.base.PlugIn.class" 
        	value="org.openmdx.base.aop1.PlugIn_1"
        />
      
      A singleton list with org.openmdx.base.aop1.StandardPlugIn_1 is used if 
      no plug-in is configured.

      leads to a JDK-log file similar to openMDX/1's log files with the 
      following main differences
      * The initial line declaring fields missing.
      * The date/time field is in extended ISO format, i.e. it includes the 
        characters 'T' and 'Z'.
      * SysLog's and AppLog's logsource field is not at openMDX/1's default 
        place but just before the message field.
      * The thread field contains the log thread id (a number starting with 10) 
        as opposed to the thread's id or name
      * The line number field is missing.

      Gateway as PersistenceManagerFactory

      The PersistenceManagerConnectionFactory is formally declared as an EJB 
      reference in the web.xml:
      
        <ejb-local-ref id="ejb_gateway">
		  <ejb-ref-name>ejb/gateway</ejb-ref-name>
          <ejb-ref-type>Session</ejb-ref-type>

          <ejb-link>test-gateway.jar#gateway-Mandatory</ejb-link>
        </ejb-local-ref>

      The PersistenceManagerFactory is formally declared as resource environment
      reference in the web.xml:
      
        <resource-env-ref id="jdo_gateway">
          <description>JDO Reference to the application's persistence manager factory</description>
          <resource-env-ref-name>persistence/gateway</resource-env-ref-name>
          <resource-env-ref-type>javax.jdo.PersistenceManagerFactory</resource-env-ref-type>
        </resource-env-ref>

      It is resolved in the Tomcat's context XML
      
        <Resource
          name="persistence/gateway"
          auth="Container"
          type="javax.jdo.PersistenceManagerFactory"

          AccessorFactoryClass="org.openmdx.base.accessor.jmi1.AccessorFactory_2"
        />

      The persistence manager factory is then acquired like that:
      
        public void init(
        ) throws ServletException {
          this.persistenceManagerFactory = JDOHelper.getPersistenceManagerFactory(
            "java:comp/env/persistence/gateway",
            (Context)null

        - valid states' views are time range views for the states' validity.
        - invalidated states' views are time point views (valid for the
          beginning of the states' validity and valid at one millisecond
          before its invalidation).

        (writable time-range view which is readable depending on the cache

      Database: Existence query during object creation. 
      IGNORE_CHECK_FOR_DUPLICATES allows to ignore the check-for-duplicate 
      test on object creation. By default, the database plugin asserts that no 
      two objects with the same identity are created. An object is only created 
      if an object retrieval with the same identity throws NOT_FOUND. The check 
      is not performed if the option is set to true. In this case it is 
      strongly recommended to set primary key constraints on the object_id / 
      idx columns.
      
      NOTE: if case of duplicate objects ids and IGNORE_CHECK_FOR_DUPLICATES 
      and database constraints turned on, a ServiceException is thrown with 
      error code MEDIA_ACCESS_FAILURE and a db-specific SQLException as cause.

      Database_1 allows to handle multiple connection managers. Connection
      managers are configured according to the name pattern ../datasource[0],
      ../datasource[1], etc. in the provider's deployment descriptor. The database 
      plugin accesses the connection managers by calling the method 
      getConnectionManager(DataproviderRequest request). By default the method 
      returns the first configured connection manager. However, the method can be 
      overriden so that it returns a connection manager according to a user-defined 
      criteria derived from the actual request.
      
      CR20006251
      Audit_1: add option returnAllInvolved. An object retrieval of an involved

      CR20006259
      Database_1: support join tables. joinTable, joinColumnEnd1 and joinColumnEnd2 
      allow to access the configured db object using a join table. The view to 
      access the configured db object is constructed as SELECT T v INNER JOIN 
      joinTable vj ON v.object_id = vj.joinColumnEnd2. Normally a find request 
      results (depending on the configured db object type) in SELECT T v WHERE 
      p$$parent = ?. With a join table the find request looks as SELECT T v INNER 
      JOIN joinTable vj ON v.object_id = vj.joinColumnEnd2 WHERE vj.joinColumnEnd1 = ?.
      Currently, join tables are only supported for DBOSlicedWithParentIdAsKey.

      A DataproviderRequest is lenient if its "lenient" context is
      set to Boolean.TRUE. Layers having their "bypassedByLenientRequests" 
      flag activated are bypassed by such lenient requests.
      
      Restriction: Either all requests of a unit of work or none must be
      lenient.
      
      The XMLImporter constructor for stated providers has an additional
      lenient argument defining whether the DataproviderRequests' "lenient"
      context is set to Boolean.TRUE or not.

      * The SLF4J sources have been re-included in the openMDX/Core source 
        tree 
      * The Logger interface has been changed into a jt file for proper Java 5 
        support

      Logging mit Log4J 
      
      1. openMDX 1 uses internally an openMDX specific logging API.
         But the log events may be forwarded via SLF4JLoggingMechanismus 
         to a foreign log system, e.g. to
         * JDK 1.4 Logger 
         * LOG4J 
         * Logback 
         * Jakarta Commons Logging (JCL) 
         * x4juli 
      2. openMDX 2 uses SLF4J as logging API.
         The log events may be processed either directly by log systems
         supporting SLF4J, e.g.
         * x4juli 
         * Logback (LOG4J's successor) 
         or they may be forwared to a foreign log system, e.g.
         * JDK 1.4 Logger 
         * LOG4J 
         * Jakarta Commons Logging (JCL) 
         
      You have the following configuration options:
      1. with openMDX log configuration
         * the new SLF4JLoggingMechansim forwards log events to SLF4J
         * the pre-exisiting configuartion options have not changed
      2. without openMDX log configuration
         * if the classes org.slf4j.impl.StaticLoggerBinder and 
           org.slf4j.impl.StaticMarkerBinder are both available in the
           system class path then all log events from log level detail
           on are forwarded to the SLF4JLoggingMechanism unless the
           slf4 would delegate back to the openMDX' native logging 
           system
         * Log events from log level warning on are forwarded to 
           openMDX' StandardErrLoggingMechanism in all other cases.

      Logging Framework
      
      We are going to swithc to SLF4J
      1. In a first step we delegate Jakarta Commons Logging requests via 
         SLF4J to SysLog
      2. In a later step we are going to delegate AppLog and SysLog requests 
         to SLF4J 

      Via SLF4J one is be able to delegate to one's preferred logging 
      framework such as
      * LogBack
      * x4juli
      * JDK14
      * Log4j
      * Simple
      * Simple-Log
      * Jakarta Commons Logging

      Database: DBOSlicedWithIdAsKey. The new object format allows to store

      object references in two columns:
      1) the object reference (rid)
      2) the object key (oid)
      DBOSlicedWithIdAsKey allows to store the object reference in a single
      column by appending rid and oid, i.e. id = rid + '/' + oid. The naming
      conventions for id type columns are:

      * the single-valued attributes are stored in table 'dbObject'
      * the multi-valued atributes are stored in sliced format in table 'dbObject2'
      For query object use 'dbObjectForQuery' and 'dbObjectForQuery2'. Below is

      Database: Support for autonum columns. The new option autonnumColumn allows
      to configure autonum columns as follows (also see Javadoc of class
      LayerConfigurationEntries):
      
      * the configuration option is 'autonumColumn'
	    * the format is dbObject.columnName [AS format]
	    * the database plugin handles autonum colums as follows:
  	    - autonum is applied for object slice creation with index 0
	        when a column is specified as autonum and no value is supplied with
	        the create request, a value of the form 'NEXTVAL(sequence name)'
	        is generated in the 'VALUES' clause of the INSERT statement
	      - a corresponding sequence with name 'namespace_columnName_SEQ'
	        must exist. For databases which do not support sequences a table 
	        namespace_columnName_SEQ must exist with column nextval.
	      - if the optional format is specified with 'AS format' a cast
	        is applied to the sequence value, e.g. CAST(sequence name AS CHAR(20)).

      openMDX 2 Query interfaces
      
      openMDX 2 Query interfaces are going to replace openMDX 1 Filter 
      interfaces and classes.
      
      The advantage of this approach is, that the query interfaces are 
      accessor independent, i.e. they can be used for example by
      * JMI accessors
      * CCI accessors
      * JDO accessors
      * ?
      
      In future there will be different ways to formulate queries
      * openMDX 2 Query interfaces (using a strongly typed API)
      * JDO query language (using stringified expressions)
      * SQL (using stringified expressions)
      * EJB 3 query language (using stringified expressions)

      MOF to Java Name Mapping

      Make openMDX' MOF to Java Name Mapping JMI 1.0 compliant

      Rules for Splitting MOF Model.ModelElement Names into Words
      * In the MOF, the name of a ModelElement is, typically, formed from one 
        or more words in some natural language and is an instance of the 
        ?NameType? i.e., any valid UTF-16 string. Since the MOF does not 
        restrict the set of strings that can be used to name a ModelElement, 
        not all ModelElement names transform directly to valid Java 
        identifiers. For example, names that include graphic characters do not 
        map to Java identifiers.
      * However, ModelElement names (or the javax.jmi.substituteName if one is 
        provided) consisting only of ASCII letters, digits, hyphens ('-'), 
        underscores ('_') and white-space characters, and conform to the 
        following syntax are subject to a JMI identifier generation pattern 
        that will result in standardized Java identifiers being generated.
      * MOF identifier syntax subject to JMI identifier mapping:
        Let ?ALPHA? be the set of upper-case alphabetic characters;
        Let ?alpha? be the set of lower-case alphabetic characters;
        Let ?num? be the set of numeric characters.
        Then:
        word ::= [ALPHA] [ALPHA | num]* [alpha | num]* | [alpha] [alpha | num]*
        white-space::= SP, CR, LF, HT, VT
        non-sig ::= { '_' | '-' | white-space }*
        MOF-identifier ::= [non-sig] word { non-sig word }* [non-sig]
      * The above syntax defines a heuristic for splitting names into a 
        sequence of words. The Java identifier is generated by reassembling the 
        words. The "non-sig" characters are non-significant to the Java 
        identifier generation rules and are discarded.
  
      Rules for Generating Identifiers
      * Identifier naming is an important issue for automatically generated 
        Java interfaces, especially when the interfaces are intended to be 
        used by applications written by human programmers. The mapping has to 
        reach a balance between conflicting requirements: 	 	
        - Syntactic correctness
          all identifiers in the mapped Java must conform to the Java syntax.
        - User friendliness
          identifiers should convey as much information as possible without 
          being overly long.
        - Conformance to existing conventions
          identifiers should conform to existing stylistic conventions.
      * In JMI, all identifiers (i.e., names of packages, names of class 
        proxies, names of operations, names of parameters, names of constants, 
        and names enumeration literals) shall conform to the following rules:
        - Package names:
          The identifier consists of lower-case alphabetic characters only.
        - Class proxy names: 
          The identifier consists of lower-case alphabetic characters with 
          the following exceptions.The first letter of the identifier is 
          capitalized. If the identifier consists of multiple words, the first
          letter of each word in the identifier is capitalized.
        - Operation names
          The identifier consists of lower-case alphabetic characters with the
          following exception. If the identifier consists of multiple words, 
          the first letter of each word except the first word, is capitalized.
        - Attribute names:
          The identifier consists of lower-case alphabetic characters with the
          following exception. If the identifier consists of multiple words, 
          the first letter of each word except the first word, is capitalized.
        - Constants
          The identifier consists of all upper-case alphabetic characters and 
          the ?_? character (used to separate words).
        - Enumeration literals
          The identifier consists of all upper-case alphabetic characters and 
          the character ?_? (used to separate words).

      State plugin: Disabling of (technical) history.
      * State management ignoring the (technical) history of an object. 
      * Only validFrom/validTo are relevant for state managment. requestedAt/
        requestedFor are ignored.
      * The list of stated objects with disabled (technical) history are
        configured on the plugin, e.g.
        
        <env-entry>
	      <env-entry-name>MODEL/DisableHistoryPathPattern[0]</env-entry-name>
	      <env-entry-type>java.lang.String</env-entry-type>

        </env-entry>
        
      * The plugin returns the context org:openmdx:compatibility:state1:StateCapable
        with the boolean attribute keepingInvalidatedStates for all stated
        objects. This allows a client to decide at runtime whether the 
        technical history of an object is active.

        static boolean isKeepingIvalidStates(
	       State statedObject
        ){
	       ContextCapable contextCapable = (ContextCapable)statedObject;
	       StateCapable stateContext = (StateCapable) contextCapable.getContext(State_1_Attributes.STATE_CONTEXT);

      Database: use preferences provider. Allow to read type and column mapping
      configuration from a preference provider. The deployment descriptor based
      deployment is still supported. The configuration retrieved from the
      preference provider overloads the deployment descriptor based configuration.
      
      NOTE: With openMDX 1 the configuration is read directly from the hard-coded 
      table PREFS_Preferences. The table has the schema:
      
			CREATE TABLE prefs_Preference(
			    object_rid nvarchar(100) NOT NULL,
			    object_oid nvarchar(200) NOT NULL,
			    object_idx int NOT NULL,
			    object__class nvarchar(100) NULL,
			    name nvarchar(100) NULL,
			    description nvarchar(100) NULL,
			    absolute_path nvarchar(200) NULL,
			    parent nvarchar(100) NULL,
			    string_value ntext NULL,
			    integer_value int NULL,
			    boolean_value nvarchar(10) NULL,
			    uri_value nvarchar(200) NULL,
			    decimal_value numeric(18,9) NULL,
			    CONSTRAINT PK_PREFS_Preferences PRIMARY KEY (object_rid, object_oid, object_idx)
			)
            
      With openMDX 2 the hard-coded access to the table PREFS_Preferences will 
      be replaced by a configurable preferences provider.

      XMI model importer supports IBM Rational Software Modeler. The importer
      can be invoked with a Java ant task e.g. as follows (also see
      openmdx/ant/etc/ant/build-library.xml). 
      
			<java 
				classname="org.openmdx.model1.exporter.xmi.XMIExporterMain"

			</java>
      
      The path map allows to specify paths of imported model projects. RSM 
      stores the locations of model projects in the workspace. However, the
      model importer needs to know the location of all referenced model
      projects explicitely. Model projects are referenced in .emx files
      as e.g. follows:
      
			href="platform:/resource/openmdx-core/org.openmdx.base.emx
			
			where openmdx-core specifies the model name. If a path map symbol is
			specified for the model project openmdx-core then 
			platform:/resource/openmdx-core is resolved to the specified path map 
			path.
      
      The following guidelines help you migrating existing models from Rational 
      Rose to RSM:
      
      The migration is a several step process:
      
      - Prepare the .mdl/.cat files so that they can be imported by the 
        RSM Rational Rose Model importer. Also prepare all referenced
        models.
      - Import the models with the RSM Rational Rose Model importer.
      - Postprocess the imported models.

      For a more detailed description of the migration process also see
      http://www.openmdx.org/documentation.

      RemoteExceptions
      
      The RemoteExceptions class has a configurable static isRetriable()
      method to be used by the framework (or applications) to determine
      whether it's safe to retry a failed remote invocation.
      
      The configuration property file is retrieved as resource from
      org/openmdx/base/exception/retriable-remote-exceptions.properties and
      each of its entries has one of following formats:
      
        <remote-exception-class>
        <remote-exception-class>*<detail-throwable-class>  
        
      The former format refers to remote exceptions retriable independent of
      its detail value, while the latter refers to remote-exceptions with
      detail value dependend retriability.
      
      The current default property file contains the following entries:

      In-process deployment
      
      Simplify in-process deployment by allowing static declaration of the 
      dataprovider connection factory.
      
      The applications and connectors should be lazyly deployed when a 
      dataprovider connection is requested.
      
      Example:
      * protected final static Dataprovider_1ConnectionFactory 
        dataproviderConnectionfactory = new 
        InProcessDataproviderConnectionFactory(
            new InProcessDeployment(

      LightweightContainter Transactions
      
      The LightweightContainer does not support transaction handling.
      It can not play the role of an XA coordinator nor can it managage
      transaction aware resource managers. Applications deployed on the
      LightweightContainer are running in the auto-commit mode of the
      configured resource managers.
      
      The LightweightContainer should be extended as follows: 
      * Add a transaction manager. Provider support the configured
        transaction policies. 
      * Support XA and non-XA resource managers. This is important for
        client deployments where not all resource managers are XA
        compliant. 
      * Support of non-optimistic transactions for clients.
      
      The resource adapter configuration for Microsoft SQL Server 2000 for
      example could look that:

      Database_1: add dbObject slicedParentRidOnly.
      The 'slicedParentRidOnly' format of a DB_OBJECT contains an index-slice of 
		  an object in one row. The schema is: 
		  0 as object_rid, object_oid, p$$parent_object__rid, p$$parent_object__oid ... 
		  The sliced does not have values for the column object_rid. Instead, it provides 
		  rid and oid for the parent object. This format is useful when the calculation 
		  of the column object_rid is expensive compared to the calculation of the 
		  parent object rid|oid.

      Enum Pattern for JRE < 1.5 
      
      Enumerations for JRE < 1.5 are sub-classes of 
      org.openmdx.uses.java.lang.Enum. They can't be used in switch 
      statements except when relying on their ordinal number, but 
      identity give the same result.
      
      Example:
      * public class AnEnumeration extends Enum {
          private AnEnumeration() {}
          public final static AnEnumeration X = new AnEnumeration();
          public final static AnEnumeration Y = new AnEnumeration();
          public final static AnEnumeration Z = new AnEnumeration();
          public static AnEnumeration[] values(){
            return (AnEnumeration[]) values(AnEnumeration.class);

          public static AnEnumeration valueOf(String name){
            return (AnEnumeration) valueOf(AnEnumeration.class, name);
          }
        }
      * It is preferred to use
          if(a==AnEnumeration.X){
          } else if (a==AnEnumeration.Y){
          } else if (a==AnEnumeration.Z}
          }
        instead of
          switch(a.ordinal()){
            case 0: // AnEnumeration.X
            break;
            case 1: // AnEnumeration.Y
            break;
            case 2: // AnEnumeration.Z

      Dependency Aware Explorer
      
      The Dependency Aware Explorer is used by replacing 
      org.openmdx.compatibility.runtime1.layer.application.Explorer_1 by
      DependencyAwareExplorer_1 in openMDX' gateway configuration.
      
      It tries to resolve the folowing oject request dependencies:
      * Requests creating an object have to be executed before requests
        referring to it
      * Requests removing an object have to be executed after requests
        referring to it

      It takes the following steps:
      1. Try to bundle all dataprovider requests belonging to the same exposed 
         path and to resolve the dependencies between these bundles and execute
         the bundles in the resulting order unless there are cycles.
      2. Try to resolve the dependencies between the individual dataprovider 
         requesst step 1 leads to cycles and execure the dataprovider requests
         in the resulting order unless there are cycles by bundling all 
         consecutive requests belonging to the same exposed path.
      3. Execute all dataprovider requests in the original order if step 2 leads
         to cycles by bundling all consecutive requests belonging to the same 
         exposed path. 
                 
      CR0002818
      Qualifier Options
      
      The plugins should offer different possibilities to create qualifiers 
      when they are unspecified upon object creation:
      1. UUID: xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx (the default) 
      2. UID: uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu 
      3. SEQUENCE: 0 .. 999999999999999999 
      4. URN: (urn:uuid:xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx) 
      Where
      x stands for [0-9a-f] 
      u stands for [0-9A-Fa-f+\-] 

      A SEQUENCE's range is
      * SEQUENCE.MIN_VALUE = 0 
      * SEQUENCE.MAX_VALUE = 10^18-1 
      When a new object is created then the SEQUENCE's current value is
      * unchanged if the qualifier contains any other character than the 
        digits 0 to 9 or if its value is outside the SEQUENCE's range 
      * set to Long.parseLong(qualifier)+1 otherwise
      
      To get a new UID for example: 
        UUIDGenerator uuidGenerator = UUIDs.getGenerator();
        String uid = UUIDConversion.toUID(uuidGenerator.next());
      For classes extending Layer_1 there is a convenience method 
        uidAsString()
      which returns
      * a UUID unless APPLICATION/compressUID is on 
      * a UID if APPLICATION/compressUID is on 
      
      The plugins create the following default qualifiers depending on their 
      configuration:
      * UUID as default 
      * UID if APPLICATION/compressUID is on 
      * SEQUENCE if APPLICATION/sequenceSupported and 
        PERSISTENCE/sequenceSupported is on 
      * URN if SEQUENCE access fails

1.    NEW FEATURES

      CR0002826
      Database_1: c$ columns in _REF table NOT NULLABLE. The c$ columns must
      be defined as NOT NULL. Unused component columns are filled with blanks.
      This allows to set a unique constraint on the columns c$0..c$n. 
      
      IMPORTANT: existing REF tables must be migrated:
      1) UPDATE ..._REF SET c$i = '' WHERE c$i IS NULL
      2) define c$i as NOT NULL
      
      The new configuration option maxReferenceComponents defines the number
      of c$i columns in a REF table which is managed by Database_1. Default
      value is 16.
      
      CR0002856

      CR0002813
      Database_1: optimize column size for references. 
      Path values are stored by default in the path.toUri() format. The 
      path macros allow to modify path values before they are stored. 
      E.g. a path of the form 
      xri:@openmdx:org.openmdx.test.app1/provider/Sliced/segment/Standard/...
      can be modified to be stored as xri:*app1.Sliced.Standard/... with
      a macro pathMacroName[i] = app1.Sliced.Standard and pathMacroValue[i] =
      xri:@openmdx:org.openmdx.test.app1/provider/Sliced/segment/Standard. 
      This feature can be used e.g. for path compression and therefore to 
      save space on database tables.

      The set() operations for attribute of stereotype stream should follow the following pattern:
      * void setX(Reader, long); // for character data 
      * void setX(InputStream, long); // for binary data

      UUID conversion
      
      There is a request to represent a UUID in another form than in its 
      standard string representation xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx, 
      where each x stands for a hexadecimal digit.
      
      The preferred compact representation would be a BASE64 encoding of its 
      byte[16] representation except for all '/' being replaced by '-' and the 
      two trailing '=' removed. This would reduce its size from the string 
      representations 36 to 22 ASCII characters.
      
      The preferred URN representation follows 
      http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-mealling-uuid-urn-04.txt. 
      
      Examples:
      * UUID:   00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000
        URN:    urn:uuid:00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000

      Deprecated XRI segments
       
      ":*" and "%" segments must be replaced by "**" respectively

      URN schema
      
      According to the IETFs directions (dropping of non-IETF trees, no 
      hierarchical URNs yet) we are going to concentrate on OASIS' XRI 
      specification:
      1. Paths: used in compatibility mode only 
      2. spice URIs: current database representation 
      3. XRIs: openMDX standard run-time and external representation 
      4. XRI derived IRIs: the preferred future database representation 
      5. XRI derived URIs: the future fallback database representation for 
         Unicode incapable databases 

      Consequences
      * Support for the "vnd-openmdx-iri" protocol has been discontinued 
      * The "spice" protocol will be deprecated with openMDX 2.

      Add locale fallback to ObjectInspectorServlet. Add locale fallback based 
      on language instead of fully qualified locale string. The fallback
      algorithm works as follows:
      - Iterate all locales configured in web.xml starting from 0, i.e.
        locale[0], locale[1], ..
      - Try to load resources from locale i, i.e. config/code/<locale i>,
        config/ui/<locale i>, config/texts/<locale i>. 
      - If no resources are found at locale i fallback to resources of

      Lightweight Container Package  
      
      The Lightweight Container and its closure must be moved to the 
      openmdx.kernel subtree.  
      
      The reason is, that the openMDX/Library openmdx-base.jar may be put into 
      the enterprise application archive and its content would therefore not 
      be available for deployment.

      NOT_FOUND Exception bei Operation OBJECT_SETTING im prolog 
      
      Despite the fix it is strongly recommended to avoid the deprecated "set" 
      operations as they interfere with the optimizations introduced in the
      meanwhile.
      
      Set operations will be supported client-side only in the future because
      they interfere with the state tarnsitions as defined by JDO: 
      Only transitions of the form TRANSIENT -> PERSISTENT-NEW -> PERSISTENT 
      allow the appropriate instance callback methods to be invoked. 
      Server-side set operations on the other side would require a state like
      MAYBE-PERSISTENT-MAYBE-PERSISTENT-NEW, meaning for example that "maybe" 
      postLoad should be invoked.
      
      The XML importer is going to handle set operations itsef from openMDX 
      2.0 on, ledinbg to an additional roundtrip per object: 
      
        DataproviderObject o = null;

			o = queryChannel.addGetRequest(accessPath)
			persistent = true;
